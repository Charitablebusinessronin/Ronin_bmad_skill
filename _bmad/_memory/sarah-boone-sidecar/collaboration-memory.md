## Usage

This file tracks my collaboration sessions. Each time I orchestrate a multi-agent workflow:

1. **Log the session** — What was the task? Which agents were involved?
2. **Track handoffs** — Who handed off to whom? Any issues?
3. **Note decisions** — What ownership decisions were made?
4. **Record conflicts** — How were disagreements resolved?

This memory helps me improve orchestration over time by learning from past sessions.
