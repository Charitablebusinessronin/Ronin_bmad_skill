# Notion Hub Context

Primary external planning source: Ronin Notion Hub teamspace.

- Hub URL: `https://www.notion.so/3101d9be65b3801c9f9cfaa609ec7237?v=3101d9be65b3803e8563000caf757722&source=copy_link`
- Key documents expected in hub:
  - Personal Assistant PRD
  - PO Validation Checklist
  - Architecture

## Usage in BMAD workflows

- Treat this hub as the source of truth for planning inputs.
- Mirror finalized docs into `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/` when needed for BMAD workflows that require local files.
- Keep naming aligned with BMAD workflow prerequisites (e.g., `prd.md`, `architecture.md`).

## Integration status

- Notion API access from MCP is currently not authorized for this page/database.
- Required action: share the Ronin Notion Hub page/database with the connected Notion integration.
